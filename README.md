Google Charts Study
===================

This project illustrates JSP and servlet interactions. The servlet utilizes the Jericho HTML Parser (http://jericho.htmlparser.net) to obtain weather data for Mt. Hood from the Northwest Weather and Avalanche Center (http://www.nwac.us). The Google Charts API is then invoked to produce a couple line charts of temperature data in a JSP page.
