DESCRIPTION:

This project illustrates JSP and servlet interactions. The servlet utilizes the Jericho html parser to obtain weather data for Mt. Hood from the Northwest Weather and Avalanche Center (http://www.nwac.us). The Google Charts API is then invoked to produce a couple line charts of temperature data in a JSP page.

USAGE:

Open the project in IntelliJ.  Setup a Tomcat server, and run the project.
